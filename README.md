**XML, unfold every tag.**

Explore elements, attributes, namespaces, text, comments, and CDATA in a searchable tree.

Use it for XML files, service responses, feeds, and configuration that needs a little room to breathe.

One JavaScript file. One scoped stylesheet. No build step. Plain JavaScript, with no runtime dependencies.

[Open the playground](https://byuwur.github.io/easy-xml-viewer/)

Open `index.html` for the local playground; its page assets require internet access.

## Installation and usage

**Recommended: CDN.** No downloads or package manager.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/byuwur/easy-xml-viewer@latest/xml.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/byuwur/easy-xml-viewer@latest/xml.min.js" defer></script>
<div id="viewer" data-theme="light"></div>
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    byXMLviewer(document.getElementById("viewer"), '<root><item id="1">Hello</item></root>', { collapsed: true });
  });
</script>
```

The CDN example uses `@latest` and requires internet access. Use a published tag or commit to pin a version.

**Local files:** For offline use, save `xml.js` and `xml.css` beside your HTML:

```html
<link href="xml.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="xml.js" defer></script>
```

Exported HTML starters use default settings, independently of playground changes.

## Input and API

`byXMLviewer(element, xml?, options?)` accepts a string; omitted input uses the target's text. Empty/whitespace-only input displays an empty state. Malformed or oversized input displays an error and resolves `ready` false.

`byXMLviewer.parse(xml)` uses the browser's XML parser and returns a detached XMLDocument, or null for empty input. It shares the renderer's parser and limits. Invalid input throws `TypeError`, `SyntaxError`, or `RangeError`.

Names retain namespace prefixes and declarations. Attribute values and character references are decoded. Node copy includes descendants and uses XMLSerializer, so quotes, entities, and empty-element formatting may differ from the source. Main Copy preserves the original source.

Copy value uses an element's textContent or a leaf's nodeValue. The XML declaration is displayed separately and excluded from node-search counts.

DTDs/DOCTYPE declarations, including internal/external entities, are rejected. Standard XML entities and numeric references are supported; declaration-like text in comments/CDATA stays ordinary data. Nodes are never imported into the page, and scripts, styles, or external resources are not activated.

Parse-error messages vary by browser. Elements named `parsererror` in the XHTML or Mozilla parser-error namespaces are reserved for error detection; use another namespace for user data with that name.

## XML options and limits

| Option           | Default | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `collapsible`    | `true`  | Show disclosure controls; false keeps every node expanded.                                                                                                                                     |
| `collapsed`      | `false` | Initially close element disclosures.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `showWhitespace` | `false` | Include whitespace-only text nodes. Significant text spacing is always retained.                                                                                                               |
| `search`         | `false` | Case-insensitive substring search over node names, attribute names/values, and leaf values. Show matching nodes and their ancestor paths, expanded. Clearing restores initial collapse policy. |
| `copyNodes`      | `false` | Show node copy buttons, including collapsed descendants.                                                                                                                                       |

Expand/collapse affects displayed elements only. Filtering leaves source XML unchanged. Mixed text and elements keep document order; indentation is for navigation.

Limits: 2 million input characters, 50,000 document nodes (including whitespace), and 256 nesting levels. DOMParser and indexing are synchronous; DOM creation yields every 100 visible nodes and search every 1,000 records. Closed branches remain in the DOM, so large documents can consume substantial memory. Re-rendering or a new search cancels obsolete DOM work.

## Shared controls and lifecycle

| Option             | Default     | Behavior                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `animations`       | `true`      | Brief control/disclosure motion and background fades; overrides the system motion preference.                                                              |
| `appearAnimation`  | `false`     | Fade and gently move the viewer in when `animations` is enabled. Initial rendering remains immediate by default.                                           |
| `toolbar`          | `true`      | Show the viewer header; secondary tools are configured separately.                                                                                         |
| `credits`          | `true`      | Show attribution in the header.                                                                                                                            |
| `displayContainer` | `true`      | Show the content panel frame and inner horizontal padding. `false` also hides status information.                                                          |
| `statusBar`        | `true`      | Show counts and metadata when `displayContainer` is true. With `statusBar: false`, loading and empty results remain visible; errors always remain visible. |
| `expandCollapse`   | `false`     | Show Expand all / Collapse all.                                                                                                                            |
| `copyValues`       | `false`     | Show copy-value buttons, independently of copyNodes.                                                                                                       |
| `theme`            | Container   | Initial `"light"` or `"dark"` mode class.                                                                                                                  |
| `palette`          | Container   | Initial `data-theme` palette, including custom CSS names.                                                                                                  |
| `fontSize`         | Container   | Number in rem or a CSS size such as `"1.25em"` or `"20px"`; bounded to `0.5rem`–`3rem`.                                                                    |
| `themeToggle`      | `true`      | Show the theme toggle.                                                                                                                                     |
| `fontSizeControls` | `true`      | Show text-size controls.                                                                                                                                   |
| `copyButton`       | `true`      | Show full source copy button.                                                                                                                              |
| `controlsSize`     | `"regular"` | `"xs"` (0.5rem), `"small"` (0.7rem), `"regular"` (0.875rem), `"large"` (1rem), or `"xl"` (1.25rem); invalid values use `"regular"`.                        |
| `controlsCompact`  | `true`      | Keep credits beside controls; `false` stacks them. Wraps as needed.                                                                                        |
| `controlsPosition` | `"top"`     | Sticky `"top"` or `"bottom"` toolbar; invalid values use `"top"`.                                                                                          |

The controller exposes `ready` and `destroy()`. `ready` resolves `true` after initial rendering, or `false` on a displayed data error or cancellation. Invalid targets/options can throw synchronously.

`ready` describes the initial render only; it does not track later searches or disclosure changes.

```javascript
const viewer = byXMLviewer(target, xml, { search: true });
const rendered = await viewer.ready; // false on data errors or cancellation.
viewer.destroy(); // Call when the host panel is removed.
```

Re-rendering disposes the previous instance. `destroy()` cancels pending work and clears the target only if the instance still owns it. Duplicate script loads preserve the API. Read its version with `byXMLviewer.VERSION`.

Input is displayed as text, never executed. Style `.byXMLdocument` with `--by-view-bg`, `--by-view-text`, `--by-view-muted`, `--by-view-border`, `--by-view-accent`, `--by-view-alt`, `--by-view-string`, and `--by-view-literal`. The container uses system-ui; source/tree content uses monospace. Override the class or target's inline font/size as needed.

Copy requires clipboard permission in a secure context.

Requires a modern browser with async functions, WeakMap, ES2022 array methods, and CSS variables. Tests run in Chromium; other engines are unverified.

`--by-view-content-font` and `--by-view-line-height` set source/tree typography.

The playground disables header-only settings while Viewer header is off, preserving their values. Appearing animation is disabled while Animations is off.

Use `toolbar: false` to hide the header, or disable `credits`, `themeToggle`, `fontSizeControls`, and `copyButton` individually. Content actions such as search and format-specific buttons use their own options.

Controls use monospace by default; override `--by-view-controls-font` to change it.

## Themes

Configure appearance in the options object or on the container:

```javascript
byXMLviewer(target, source, {
  theme: "dark",
  palette: "github",
  fontSize: 1.125
});
```

`theme` sets the mode class; `palette` sets `data-theme`. `fontSize` numbers use rem (`1` = the root text size); CSS sizes such as `"1.25em"`, `"1.25rem"`, and `"20px"` are also accepted. All sizes stay between `0.5rem` and `3rem`. Explicit options override markup; omitted or `null` values retain the container's settings. A named palette preserves its existing mode, including the `data-theme="light"` / `"dark"` aliases. Invalid appearance values throw `RangeError` before replacing the current document. Text-size Reset returns to the configured size, including after re-rendering.

Initial content appears immediately unless `appearAnimation: true` is requested with animations enabled. Theme backgrounds fade briefly on shared surfaces; font size, rows, and syntax tokens change immediately. High Contrast and forced-color backgrounds switch immediately. Animations also affect controls and deliberate show/hide actions. Disclosure size/exit transitions progressively enhance browsers that support them.

The outer document and inner surfaces have independent CSS backgrounds. Both follow the selected theme unless overridden. Set `--by-view-document-bg: #0000` to reveal the host page while keeping content panels and individual controls readable. `--by-view-container-bg` sets the shared background of those panels and controls; it also accepts alpha colors or `transparent`. The toolbar and credits have no background. These overrides survive theme changes.

```css
.byXMLdocument {
  --by-view-document-bg: #0000;
}
```

The playground uses SPA.js's Pickr assets for color and opacity, with text inputs when Pickr is unavailable. **Copy CSS** exports the appearance overrides; clear a field to restore its theme default. The renderer needs no color-picker dependency.

**48 palettes, each with Light and Dark modes.** Monokai, GitHub, Solarized, and High Contrast are included in `xml.css`. Load the optional `xml.themes.css` after it for the other 44 skins:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/byuwur/easy-xml-viewer@latest/xml.themes.min.css" />
```

For local use, save `xml.themes.css` beside `xml.css`. The playground loads both stylesheets; default HTML starters use the core stylesheet. Known extra presets without the pack fall back to the current mode and emit a one-time `console.warn` naming the required file. Custom CSS names do not need the pack.

The picker groups palettes into Essentials, Editor classics, App inspired, Colorful, and Reading & nature. Palette definitions remain at the end of each stylesheet.

Editor and app skins are inspired adaptations, including light counterparts where needed; colors are adjusted for readable text and controls rather than exact replicas. All palettes use the same layout and need no assets beyond the core stylesheet and optional theme pack.

Use a mode class and a palette name together:

```html
<div id="viewer" class="dark" data-theme="github"></div>
<!-- High Contrast Light: class="light" data-theme="high-contrast" -->
<!-- High Contrast Dark: class="dark" data-theme="high-contrast" -->
```

Rendering adds `.byXMLdocument`; its variables affect only that container and its children. The theme switch changes mode while keeping the palette; re-rendering preserves both. A named palette without a mode class starts in Light; if both mode classes are present, Dark wins.

`data-theme="light"` and `data-theme="dark"` select Monokai and override mode classes. A mode class alone, or no explicit theme, also uses Monokai.

### High Contrast

High Contrast text colors target at least [7:1 contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html), with [3:1 contrast for control boundaries and focus cues](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html). Check contrast again when you override colors.

### Make it yours

The playground's **Custom theme CSS** field edits both modes of the selected palette. Export those rules to your own stylesheet and use `data-theme="custom"` with `class="light"` or `class="dark"`. Custom drafts stay in the playground; the renderer does not store them.

Define a named palette after the viewer stylesheet. Unspecified colors inherit Monokai:

```css
.byXMLdocument.light[data-theme="my-ocean"] {
  --by-view-bg: #f3f8fc;
  --by-view-text: #102a43;
  --by-view-border: #486581;
  --by-view-accent: #005a9c;
}

.byXMLdocument.dark[data-theme="my-ocean"] {
  --by-view-bg: #102a43;
  --by-view-text: #f0f6fc;
  --by-view-border: #9fb3c8;
  --by-view-accent: #8cd3ff;
}
```

```html
<div id="viewer" class="dark" data-theme="my-ocean"></div>
```

Named palettes need no JavaScript registration or extra theme files.

In the playground configuration, `theme` is the mode, `palette` is its name, and `customThemeCSS` holds custom rules. Null appearance values inherit defaults. Pass only documented API options to the renderer.

**Copy CSS** exports typography and individual color overrides. Inline colors override palette variables; clear them or Reset to restore palette defaults.

Text-size controls change only this viewer, in `0.125rem` steps from `0.5rem` to `3rem`, independently of button size. **A** restores its initial size; re-rendering preserves the selected size.

### Legacy theme links

Legacy integrations can use `#byVIEWtheme` or a detected `xml.light.css` / `xml.dark.css` link. The toggle keeps its path, query, and hash and updates viewers sharing the link. Explicit container themes stay independent. Separate theme files are no longer shipped; retain your hosted legacy files to use this alternative.

## Checks

Theme tests cover both modes, container isolation, legacy links, custom CSS, and High Contrast. Clipboard tests use stubs; they do not verify real permissions.

Playground tests fetch the pinned Bootstrap stylesheet unless `BOOTSTRAP_CSS_PATH` points to a cached copy.

Install Playwright outside the repository and set `NODE_PATH` to its `node_modules` directory:

```sh
node --check xml.js
node --test tests/rendering.cjs   # Library
node --test tests/playground.cjs  # Playground
```

`BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` uses installed Chrome; `CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE_PATH` selects a Chromium executable. Otherwise, install Playwright Chromium. [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/rendering.yml) reports Library and Playground as independent jobs; a failed suite does not cancel the other.
